# Churn_Analysis using ANN
Customer Churn Rate is a metric used to measure the percentage of customer discontinuation of a service or product provided within a certain period of time. Usually the Churn Rate uses a monthly period. To calculate the Churn Rate, you can use the formula: Number of customers who quit divided by Total customers at the beginning of the month. This is something that companies must pay attention to because the Customer Churn Rate is an obstacle to growth. Aside from inhibiting the growth, loss of customers also means a loss of income (Revenue Churn Rate).

This repository contains scripts or source code about how to predict customer churn rate at a bank using **Artificial Neural Network**.
We are having the dataset of the bank for the 10000 customers. The Bank is seeing the unsual Churn rate. In the 'Excited' Column there are 2 variables i.e., 1(Churn customer) and 0(non-churn customer). Your objective is to tell which of the customer is at higher risk of leaving.
